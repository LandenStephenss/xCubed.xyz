# Information Collection And Use

xCubed collects very little information on users.
## What data is collected?
The only thing that xCubed collects from a user is their `userID`, `avatar`, and `username` for backend purposes. The rest of the data that is stored are things for the bot to function, such as currency and level things.
Here is an example of what is stored by xCubed;
